    <section class="about-text">Name is a medical and scientific illustrator and animator with a Master of Science in Biomedical Communications (MScBMC) from the University of Toronto. She also holds a double major undergraduate degree in Cognitive Science and Public Health Studies from Johns Hopkins University.

Working in the field of medical and scientific visual communication allows her to combine her rigorous science background with her passion for art and design. Classical realism training at the Schuler School of Fine Arts has given her solid footing informed by techniques of traditional masters, while her MScBMC is an accreditation of skill in current digital 2D and 3D media.

Her motivation is to put art and visual design into the service of science, to disseminate information to audiences, targeted or broad. Clients she has visualised for include physicians, research scientists, educators, and medical legal professionals.

Her work has been published in the journal of Nature methods and has been recognized by the Association of Medical Illustrators with an award of excellence.
